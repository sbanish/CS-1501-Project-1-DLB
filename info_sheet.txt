Does your program run without error?:

No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

Every single part of my program runs without error except my time tracking part. I was able to implement the Symbol Table, nanoTime call, however, it was not working efficiently/correctly,
so I decided to comment it out for the ease of grading.
